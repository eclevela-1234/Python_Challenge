# Python_Challenge
Python scripts used to analyze large banking and polling datasets

- key points learned: Syntax, Syntax, Syntax
- for loop structure
- strengths and limitations of base Python Libraries
- ways to fin answers
- better ar catching syntax error: school of brute force!

PyBank
    -   used absolute value to sum changes in Profit/Losses: the example showed a negative change average which didn't make sense to me
    - most of the hard syntax learning was on this portion

PyPoll
    - Khan wins!: Used Max funtion to determine winner
    - used lots of snippets from PyBank to quickly build this script.
